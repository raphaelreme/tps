class ThinPlateSpline:
    """Solve the Thin Plate Spline interpolation.

    In fact, this class supports the more general multi-dimensional polyharmonic spline interpolation.

    It learns a non-linear elastic mapping function f: R^d -> R given n control points (x_i, y_i)_i
    where x_i \\in R^d and y_i \\in R.

    The problem is formally stated as:
    f = min_f E_{fit}(f) + \\alpha E_{reg}(f)      (1)

    where E_{fit}(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2  (Least square objectif)
    and E_{reg}(f) = \\int \\|\\nabla^{order} f \\|_2^2 dx (Regularization)
    which penalizes the norm of the order-th derivatives of the learnt function.

    When the regularization alpha is 0, then this becomes equivalent to minimizing E_{reg}
    under the constraints f(x_i) = y_i.

    NOTE: In the classical 2 dimensionnal TPS, the spline order is 2.

    Using Euler-Lagrange, one can show that the function solutions are of the form:
    f(x) = P(x) + \\sum_i w_i G(\\|x - x_i\\|_2), with P a polynom of degree = order - 1
    and G are radial basis functions (RBF).

    It can be shown that the RBF follows:

    G(r) = r**(2 * order - d) log(r) for even dimension d
    or
    G(r) = r**(2 * order - d) for odd dimension d

    For TPS, this sets G(r) = r**2 log(r)
    As RBF, are not always defined in r = 0 (if 2 * order \\le d), we decided to use the common
    (but incorrect) TPS kernel instead of the mathematical one.

    Fitting the spline, amounts at finding the polynoms coefficients and the weights (w_i).

    Vectorized solution:
    --------------------

    Let X = (x_i) \\in R^{n x d} and Y = (y_i) \\in R^{n x v} be the control points and associated values.
    And X' = (x'_i) \\in R^{n' x d} be any set of points where we want to interpolate f.

    Note that we now have several values to interpolate for each position, which simply amounts at finding
    a mapping f_j for each value and concatenating them.

    X and X' can expended as its polynomial features X_p \\in R^{n x d_p} and X'_p \\in R^{n' x d_p}.
    For instance, TPS, the polynom is of degree one and the polynomial extension is simply the homogenous
    coordinates: X_p = (1, X). See PolynomialFeatures for more information.

    Let's call K(X') \\in R^{n' x n} the matrix of RBF values for any X'. K(X') = G(cdist(X', X)): it is the
    RBF applied to the radial distances to the control points.

    The polynoms coefficients can be vectorized into a matrix C \\in R^{d_p x v} (one polynom for each value)
    and finally we can also vectorize the RBF weights into W \\in R^{n x v} (One weight for each control point
    and each value).

    The function f can now be vectorized as:
    f(X') = X'_p C + K(X') W

    Learning the parameters C and W is done by solving the following system with the control points X:
            A      .   P   =   B
                          <=>
    |  K(X) , X_p |  | W |   |Y |
    |             |  |   | = |  |       (2)
    | X_p^T ,  0  |  | C |   |0 |

    The first row enforces f(X) = Y and the second adds orthogonality constraints.
    The system can be relaxed when \\alpha != 0, then one can show that same system can be solved
    by simply replacing K(X) by K(X) + alpha I.

    To transform X', one can simply apply the learned parameters P = (W, C) with
    Y' = f(X') = X'_p C + K(X') W

    In our notations, we have:
    A \\in R^{(n + d_p) x (n + d_p)}
    P \\in R^{(n + d_p) x v}
    Y \\in R^{(n + d_p) x v}

            Default: 2 (Suited for TPS interpolation)

            This should be sub-optimal, but it yields good results in practice.
